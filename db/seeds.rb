# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# class CreateStory < Neo4j::Migrations::Base
#   def up
#     add_constraint :Story, :uuid
#   end

#   def down
#     drop_constraint :Story, :uuid
#   end
# end
